Weapons can configure what type of wound(s) they will cause, a la D&D damage types.
Examples:
- A hammer deals bludgeoning damage
- A sword deals slashing damage
- A spear deals piercing damage

Potentially allow weapons to deal ratios of different damage types, .e.g a weapon deals 50% slashing and 50% piercing damage.
