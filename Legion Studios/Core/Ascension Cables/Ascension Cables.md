## Overview
"Something cool, but not necessarily practical"

Magazine has two bullets, one for the beginning and end of the rope
 - Allows you to either climb / rappel or make a zip line that you can move across

Max length of 90 meters (arma has limit of 100m, so no issue)

## Steps
1. Load magazine
2. Ascension cable hook is shown on the barrel if gun is set up for it
3. Shoot the cable
	- Shooting once attaches a rope to the bullet and the weapon's muzzle
	- Shooting twice attaches a rope between the two hit positions
		- Can shoot while riding zipline
		- Dummy vehicle is attached to two ropes, W/S causes one rope to unwind while the other winds.
		- Dummy vehicle is used for each unit on the rope, with new ropes attaching each one
	- Cannot fire while cable is attached to the muzzle, user action to move the rope to your belt
		- Allows firing when on the belt, so that you can attach another rope to something else
