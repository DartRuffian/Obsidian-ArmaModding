Players will be able to repair vehicles by shooting a specific component with the fusion cutter. The fusion cutter would be limited to field repairs. E.g. a player would only be able to repair a vehicle component up to an "orange" level of damage, but being near a repair vehicle (vanilla / ACE) would allow the player to repair it fully.

Note that the `onHit` event will only trigger if a bullet actually penetrates the vehicle's armor. Meaning the ammo used will need to have a high penetration but low damage value.
