## My launcher magazines aren't appearing in crates, vehicles, etc. but work fine from the arsenal
Do you use the magazine for a disposable launcher with CBA? CBA will replace magazines for disposable launchers with pre-loaded launchers. You will need separate magazine classes for the normal and disposable launchers.
