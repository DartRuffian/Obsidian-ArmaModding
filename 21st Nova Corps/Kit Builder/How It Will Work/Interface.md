So long as players are choosing the correct options (Rank etc), the GUI will only show selections that are available to players. For example the vest selection that a player sees will depend on the rank they have selected, and the vests that a specific kit is allowed to use.

It is important that the interface is approachable and not cluttered. The GUI should have a positive impact on the process of new members retrieving their kits for the first time.
