# Idea
Create a GUI to replace the arsenal. The GUI should allow for the same level of customization that our kits currently feature. The GUI should be intuitive to use. The GUI cannot be more hassle to use than the ACE arsenal.

Kits that people have saved should still work after the loadout scripts have been updated. Data must be saved as the selections that people have made rather than saving a list of items.

### Benefits:
- As a new player, grabbing and saving kits will be very easy
- Any updates to kits will happen seamlessly
- We will be able to retain the customizability of our current kits without arsenal access.
