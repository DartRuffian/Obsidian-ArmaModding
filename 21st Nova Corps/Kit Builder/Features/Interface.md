So long as players are choosing the correct options (Rank etc), the GUI will only show selections that are available to players. For example the vest selection that a player sees will depend on the rank they have selected, and the vests that a specific kit is allowed to use.

It is important that the interface is approachable and not cluttered. The GUI should have a positive impact on the process of new members retrieving their kits for the first time.

Provide visual representations of the items in the loadout, including 3D models or icons, to help players better understand their choices. Easily done by reading the item's `picture` property and displaying it in the interface.
